# Project-Rating
This is the new way to rate your overall project and CAD prints

## Rotten Filaments (est. 2021 by Shrey Panicker & invested in by Jude Benton House)

Welcome to rotten filaments. The rotten but ripe rating system of the 3D printing world. Rate your CAD prints for your projects on this scale of 0%-100%, with 0 being "It was so bad we didn't even print it..." and 100 being "That was probably the best version of the print we could've done with the materials and opportunities we had!" Obviously every project has room for improvement, so it's not likely we'll see many 100s.

## GAP (Graveyard for All Projects.Est 2021 by Shrey Panicker and Jude Benton House)

This is the big fish, the mother of all rating scales, GAP. The Graveyard for All Projects - Dead and Alive. Rate your overall project on this scale of 0%-100%, with 0 being "We couldn't finish the project and it was never going to work with this design" and 100 being "We finished it and it was the best version of this project it could be with the materials and opportunities we had!". Sound familiar? Yeah. It's kind of like the Rotten Filaments, but like a bigger sibling.
