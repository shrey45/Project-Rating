# Project-Rating
This is the new way to rate your overall project and CAD prints

## Rotten Filaments (est. 2021 by Shrey Panicker & invested in by Jude Benton House)

Welcome to rotten filaments. The rotten but ripe rating system of the 3D printing world. Rate your CAD prints for your projects on this scale of 0%-100%, with 0 being "It was so bad we didn't even print it..." and 100 being "That was probably the best version of the print we could've done with the materials and opportunities we had!" Obviously every project has room for improvement, so it's not likely we'll see many 100s.
